            <p>I am who I am, I am what I am, I do what I do and I ain't never gonna do it any different.I don't need
                your approval to be me.Why chase you, when I am the catch!Take me as I am, or watch me as I go.If I were
                you, I would adore me.I am perfect.Love yourself first, and everything else falls in line.“Talk to
                yourself like someone you love.”To fall in love with yourself is the first secret to happiness.How you
                love yourself is how you teach others to love you.Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.

            <p>I can't stop thinking about you.You'll always be my girl.Since the day I met you, my life has never been
                the same.I love making you laugh.I love you more than pepperoni pizza.You're my dream girl.You are my
                healer.You ground me.Why, darling, I don't live at all when I'm not with you. I seem to have loved you
                in numberless forms, numberless times, in life after life, in age after age forever. If you live to be a
                hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you.</p>
